A data story.
Once upon a time, some data was created by a random internet user and abandoned in a sea of unstructured data.
An algorithm passed by and decided to add xml tags to the text, and so it became semi-structured.
A data manager stumbled upon the data and thought it would be relevant for the database users, so she decided to add it to her relational database. 
So it became structured.
Then a cat walked over the data manager's keyboard.
The cat typed kjdsfacm;oi34dc.
The end?
