A data story.
Once upon a time, some data was created by a random internet user and abandoned in a sea of unstructured data.
An algorithm passed by and decided to add xml tags to the text, and so it became semi-structured.
A data manager stumbled upon the data and thought it would be relevant for the database users, and so she decided to add it to her relational database. 
And so it became structured.
And then a cat walked over the data manager's keyboard.
The cat typed kjdsfacm;oi34dc.
I then thought to myself, "what if I could make this cat do something useful"?
So I asked the cat politely to finish all of my assignments for me and I sat in amazement watching the cat type away.
Later I received my mark of F- and decided that I need to reevaluate my life decisions.
